## 2022 summer internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)

During the summer of 2022 I had the opportunity to join NCAR through the SIParCS (Summer internships in parallel computational sciences) internship program. My internship focused on the python package and open source project [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/#). The majority of my time was spent developing educational materials to support the analysis of cloud-hosted remote sensing datasets using xarray, though I was able to participate in other activities both at NCAR and within the open-source community more broadly. You can read more about my internship experience [here](https://xarray.dev/blog/siparcs-2022). The tutorials developed during my internship are linked below:
