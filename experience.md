## 2022 summer internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)

During the summer of 2022 I had the opportunity to join the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) through the SIParCS (Summer internships in parallel computational sciences) internship program. My internship focused on the python package and open source project [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/#). The majority of my time was spent developing educational materials to support the analysis of cloud-hosted remote sensing datasets using xarray, though I was able to participate in other activities both at NCAR and within the open-source community more broadly. You can read more about my internship experience [here](https://xarray.dev/blog/siparcs-2022). The tutorials developed during my internship are linked below:

## Graduate research assistant, Snow & Ice Research Lab, Geography Dept., University of Utah

Most of my work in the Snow & Ice Research Lab focuses on using satellite remote sensing imagery to better understand glacier variability in High Mountain Asia. I am interested in examining changes in glacier flow, and have experience using ice velocity datasets derived from optical and synthetic aperture radar imagery including Landsat7,8,9 and Sentinel-1. I am also interested in wider applications of synthetic aperture radar imagery to examine physical processes in the cryosphere. I enjoy working with large and complex datasts, and am particularly excited about open-source tools to aid in the processing and analysis of these datasets.
