# About me

Thanks for stopping by my page! My name is Emma Marshall. I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Cryosphere Lab](https://github.com/UofU-Cryosphere) within the [Geography Department](https://geog.utah.edu/) at the University of Utah. My research uses remote sensing data to examine recent glacier variability in High Mountain Asia. I'm particularly interested in better understanding the behavior of lake-terminating glaciers and their importance to glacier mass balance projections for the region. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy skiing, mountain biking and hiking with my dog. You can also find me knitting and exploring Salt Lake City by bike in my free time. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions abotu my work or would like to chat!
