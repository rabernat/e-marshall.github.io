Thanks for stopping by my page! My name is Emma and I'm a second year PhD student in the Geography department at the University of Utah. I am also a member of the Snow and Ice Research Lab at the University of Utah. My research uses remote sensing data to examine recent glacier variability in High Mountain Asia. I'm particularly interested in better understanding the role and behavior of lake-terminating glaciers in this region. I use a variety of tools and data in my research including surface velocity data derived from optical imagery as well as synthetic aperture radar interferometry. 

When I'm not working I enjoy skiing, mountain biking and hiking with my dog. You can also usually find me exploring Salt Lake City by bike and knitting in my free time. 
Please don't hestitate to reach out if you have any questions about my work or would like to chat!
