# About me 

Thanks for stopping by my page! My name is Emma Marshall. I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Cryosphere Lab](https://github.com/UofU-Cryosphere) within the [Geography Department](https://geog.utah.edu/) at the University of Utah. My research uses remote sensing data to examine recent glacier variability in High Mountain Asia. I'm particularly interested in better understanding the behavior of lake-terminating glaciers and their importance to glacier mass balance projections for the region. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy skiing, mountain biking and hiking with my dog. You can also find me knitting and exploring Salt Lake City by bike in my free time. 

Please don't hestitate to reach out if you have any questions about my work or would like to chat! 

# Experience

## 2022 summer internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)

During the summer of 2022 I had the opportunity to join NCAR through the SIParCS (Summer internships in parallel computational sciences) internship program. My internship focused on the python package and open source project [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/#). The majority of my time was spent developing educational materials to support the analysis of cloud-hosted remote sensing datasets using xarray, though I was able to participate in other activities both at NCAR and within the open-source community more broadly. You can read more about my internship experience [here](https://xarray.dev/blog/siparcs-2022). The tutorials developed during my internship are linked below: 

1. [Using xarray to examine cloud-based glacier surface velocity data](https://e-marshall.github.io/itslive/intro.html)

2. [Sentinel-1 RTC data workflows with xarray](https://e-marshall.github.io/sentinel1_rtc/intro.html)
