Welcome! Thank you for stopping by my page. My name is Emma and I'm a second year PhD student in the Geography department at the University of Utah. Within the Geography department I am a membere of the Snow & Ice Research Lab. My research uses remote sensing data to examine recent glacier variability in High Mountain Asia. I'm particularly interested in lake-terminating glaciers and the ways in which their interactions with climate differ from land-terminating glaciers. I love remote sensing and am excited about various applications (glaciological and otherwise) for synthetic aperture radar data and interferometry.
